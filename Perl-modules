Perl modules required for zigzag and zizl
-----------------------------------------

zigzag requires Curses
zizl requires libwww-perl
libwww-perl requires MD5, MIME-Base64, HTML-Parser and libnet
libnet requires Data-Dumper

To use zigzag you will need to obtain and install the Curses
Perl module from http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Curses

To use zizl you will need to obtain and install the following
Perl modules from http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/

Data-Dumper
HTML-Parser
MD5
MIME-Base64
libnet
libwww-perl

Note that if you are using Red Hat Linux, the MD5 module is also available
as an RPM called "perl-MD5".  If you have already installed this you do
not need to download and install it again now.

For each module (in the order above) extract the tar file and change to
the directory containing the extracted files, then:

perl Makefile.pl
make
make test
make install

This is also documented in the README file for each module.
Once you have successfully tested and installed all the required
modules, you may safely delete all the extracted files and directories.
