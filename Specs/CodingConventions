# Note: We are using the following coding conventions:
# Constants are named in ALLCAPS
# Global variables are named with Initial Caps
# Local variables and functions are named in lowercase
# Put brackets around all function arguments
# Prototype the number and type of arguments expected by functions
# Matching braces should line up with each other vertically
# Use the $TRUE and $FALSE constants instead of "1" and "0"
