OSMIC cell structure
--------------------

Outline-parent cell (first left, moving upwards) contains the primedia filename
Each cell of type "O" contains one or more pointers of the form [x+y] where x
is a numeric character offset from the start of the primedia and y is a numeric
character length.


Simple export/import format
---------------------------

The type and contents of each cell along a rank is exported to a text file with
each cell separated by a line break.  Line breaks within cells are immediately
followed by a vertical bar.  On import, lines commencing with a vertical bar
are appended to the current cell with the vertical bar deleted, and cells are
inserted into a new rank.  Other connections are not preserved in this format.


To Do list
----------
* Function which scans a named file looking for one or more emails
  and builds a list of cells containing OSMIC pointers to each email
* Function which retrieves primedia described by an OSMIC pointer
  (used to display cell contents for an OSMIC type cell)
* OSMIC pointer edit operations, initially shorten/lengthen beginning/end
* Cell contents visualisation, lower right quadrant and full window,
  view changes bound to the space bar
* Simple cell export/import functions
* Implement contain/contain2 dimensions for cell execution and visualisation
